Fake Review Detection Project
Overview
This project uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to detect fake reviews in a dataset containing genuine and misleading reviews. The solution includes feature extraction, data preprocessing, and model training to classify reviews based on text patterns. We employ machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines, as well as deep learning models (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks) to improve detection accuracy.

Requirements
•	Python 3.7 or higher
•	Install required packages using:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
•	Key packages:
o	scikit-learn
o	tensorflow (for deep learning model)
o	nltk
o	pandas
o	numpy
Usage
1.	Preprocess the Data: Run the preprocess.py script to clean and prepare the dataset for training.
bash
Copy code
python src/preprocess.py
2.	Train the Model: Choose a model (Naive Bayes, SVM, or RNN) and train it on the preprocessed dataset.
bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py --model nb   # For Naive Bayes
python src/train_model.py --model svm  # For SVM
python src/train_model.py --model rnn  # For RNN
The trained model will be saved in the models directory.
3.	Evaluate the Model: Use the evaluate_model.py script to check accuracy, precision, and recall.
bash
Copy code
python src/evaluate_model.py --model nb  # For Naive Bayes evaluation
4.	Run Test Cases: Use test_cases.py to run specific edge cases and verify model robustness.
bash
Copy code
python src/test_cases.py
Dataset
Use a dataset containing labeled reviews, with each entry labeled as 0 (genuine) or 1 (fake). You can use datasets from Kaggle or create a synthetic dataset for training and evaluation.
Test Cases
Various test cases (e.g., short reviews, repeated phrases) are provided in test_cases.py to check the model’s effectiveness across different scenarios.

Model Performance
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Typical model performance metrics (achieved on sample dataset):
•	Naive Bayes: ~85% accuracy
•	Support Vector Machine (SVM): ~90% accuracy
•	Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): ~92% accuracy
These results may vary depending on the dataset and preprocessing techniques used.

Future Improvements
•	Use advanced deep learning models, such as LSTM and transformers.
•	Experiment with different feature extraction techniques (e.g., word embeddings).
•	Expand dataset and fine-tune models for better generalization.
